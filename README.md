# üìà Stock Market Performance 2024 - Intelligent PDF Query System

This project implements an **Intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that allows users to query a PDF document containing information about **Stock Market Performance in 2024**. The system uses **LangGraph**, **Groq's LLaMA-3 model**, and **ChromaDB** to provide accurate, citation-backed answers.

## üìå Project Overview

* **Goal**: Query a financial report (Stock Market Performance 2024) and retrieve precise, citation-based answers.
* **Method**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using PDF as the knowledge base.
* **Key Features**:

  * PDF loading and preprocessing with `PyPDFLoader`
  * Text chunking for efficient retrieval
  * Vector embeddings using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`
  * Vector store creation with **ChromaDB**
  * LLM reasoning with **ChatGroq (LLaMA-3 70B)**
  * Retrieval pipeline orchestration via **LangGraph**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Load the PDF using **PyPDFLoader**.
2. Split text into chunks with **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**.
3. Create embeddings with **HuggingFace MiniLM**.
4. Store vectors in **ChromaDB**.
5. Use **LangGraph** to manage conversation and tool usage.
6. Call **ChatGroq (LLaMA-3)** to answer user queries.
7. Retrieve supporting document chunks for citation.
